basic-vm
========

An extremely rudimental vm built in C to provide me with a method of exploring low-level systems. Nothing other than integer arithmetic is supported. I will hopefully get round to floating point, eventually.

Instruction set is currently as follows:

0 - Halt
1 - Load integer
2 - Add
3 - Subtract
4 - Divide
5 - Multiply
